        // reduced (inversely proportional to the compression of the space, which is given by the jacobian of
        // the deformation function). But even with dual numbers or automatic differentiation, it's usually just easier
        // to find the constant by hand for a given primitive.
        // I'd say that while it is tempting to use a distortion or displacement to achieve a given shape, and I

        // exact euclidean primitive operations(elongation, rounding, onioning, union) or tight bounded functions
        // (intersection, subtraction) and then only apply as small of a distortion or displacement as possible.
