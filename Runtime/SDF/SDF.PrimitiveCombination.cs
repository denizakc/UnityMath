        // Primitive combinations -------------------------------------

        //Sometimes you cannot simply elongate, round or onion a primitive, and you need to combine,
        //carve or intersect basic primitives. Given the SDFs d1 and d2 of two primitives,
        //you can use the following operators to combine together.

        // These are the most basic combinations of pairs of primitives you can do. They correspond to the basic
        // boolean operations. Please note that only the Union of two SDFs returns a true SDF, not the Subtraction
        // or Intersection. To make it more subtle, this is only true the exterior of the SDF
        // (where distances are positive) and not the interior. You can learn more about this and how to work around
        // it the article "Interior Distances". Also note that opSubtraction() is not commutative and depending
        // on the order of the operand it will produce different results.


        // Smooth Union, Subtraction and Intersection - bound, bound, bound -----------------

        // Blending primitives is a really powerful tool - it allows to construct complex and organic shapes without
        // the geometrical seams that normal boolean operations produce. There are many flavors of such operations,
        // but the basic ones try to replace the min() and max() functions used the opUnion, opSubtraction and
        // opIntersection above with smooth versions. They all accept an extra parameter called k that defines the
        // size of the smooth transition between the two primitives. It is given actual distance units.
